# Icons

This directory should contain application icons:

- `icon.png` - Main application icon (512x512 recommended)
- `tray-icon.png` - System tray icon (16x16 or 32x32)

You can create these icons using tools like:
- [Icon Kitchen](https://icon.kitchen/)
- [App Icon Generator](https://appicon.co/)
- Design tools like Figma, Sketch, or Adobe Illustrator

For now, the application will use fallback icons if these files are not present.
